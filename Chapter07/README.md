## 7.1 Automated Reasoning

### :star: `Definition` Automated Reasoning
Automated reasoning is the study of using computers to simulate the activity of human reasoning. It includes:
- Automated theorem proving (reasoning based on propositional logic)
- Logic programming (reasoning based on first order logic)
- Higher order logic programming (reasoning based on higher order logic)
- Automated abduction (reasoning based on abduction)
- Fuzzy reasoning (reasoning based on fuzzy logic)
- Case-based reasoning
- Frame-based reasoning

Automated Reasoning can be divided into two categories: monotonic and non-monotonic. A reasoning system is monotonic if the set of axioms and the
set of derived consequences will never decrease. Otherwise it
is a non-monotonic system.
