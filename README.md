Artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly evolved in recent years, and logic and reasoning have been fundamental to the field since its inception. Prolog is a logic programming language that has been widely used in AI research and development due to its ability to implement logical and rule-based systems. This tutorial material will provide an overview of AI programming and reasoning, and focus on the use of Prolog for logic-based programming.

The first section will introduce the field of AI programming and reasoning, providing a brief history and overview of its applications. In the subsequent sections, we will delve into the basics of logic, including propositional logic, first-order logic, and higher-order logic. These logics will be illustrated with examples and exercises to solidify your understanding.

The next two sections will focus on SLD-resolution, a widely used technique in Prolog for inference and logical reasoning. You'll learn how to implement Prolog programs that can reason and deduce logical conclusions using this technique.

Following that, we will discuss natural language processing (NLP), which is a critical component of AI systems. We'll explore how Prolog can be used for NLP tasks, such as parsing and understanding natural language sentences.

The final sections will cover planning in robotics, which is an essential part of AI applications. We'll discuss how planning is accomplished in robotics, and how Prolog can be used to develop planning systems. We will conclude with a discussion of the semantic web and its use in AI systems.

Overall, this tutorial material will provide you with a strong foundation in AI programming and reasoning using Prolog, which can be applied to a wide range of real-world AI problems.
